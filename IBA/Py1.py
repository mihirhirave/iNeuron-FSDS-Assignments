Test case 1:

The input string contains repeated words such as "write" and "from"
The word "write" occurs 3 times, while the word "from" occurs 3 times
The maximum frequency is 3, which corresponds to the word "write"
The length of the highest-frequency word "write" is 5
Therefore, the expected output is 5


Test case 2:

The input string contains repeated words such as "world", "going", "fly"
The word "world" occurs 3 times, the word "going" occurs 3 times, the word "fly" occurs 4 times
The maximum frequency is 4, which corresponds to the word "fly"
The length of the highest-frequency word "fly" is 3
Therefore, the expected output is 3


Test case 3:

The input string contains repeated words such as "I", "know", "how", "float"
The word "I" occurs 2 times, the word "know" occurs 2 times, the word "how" occurs 2 times, the word "float" occurs 3 times
The maximum frequency is 3, which corresponds to the word "float"
The length of the highest-frequency word "float" is 5
Therefore, the expected output is 5
